	Updated repeating items to make specialization and expertise buttons 15 characters if the actual display name is greater than 15

	Revamped Weapons->Melee to remove unused fields (Reach, AP, etc) and add range blocks and Specialization and Expertise checkboxes.
	Added functionality so if Close Combat skill rating is changed it updates the dice roller for melee weapons.
