# Alternity 2018 Sheet

This character sheet is designed to be used with the 2018 edition of the Alternity roleplaying game.

## Alternity Disambiguation

At the time of writing, there were two editions of Alternity:

* **Alternity 1998.** 
  * Published by TSR (later Wizards of the Coast) in 1998. [More info.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternity)
  * This sheet isn't designed for this version. See instead [this sheet](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/Alternity-RPG).
* **Alternity 2018.**
  * Published by [Sasquatch Game Studios](http://www.sasquatchgamestudio.com/products/alternity/) in 2018.
  * Available for purchase on [Drive Thru RPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/245263/Alternity-Core-Rulebook).

The shared name is not a coincidence. The two systems share authors, rules and a general *vibe*.

# Using the Sheet

This sheet should be selectable when creating a new game on Roll20. For more information, see [here](https://roll20.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037773373).

Be aware there are multiple Alternity sheets. If you want to use this one, take care to select the 2018 edition.

# Design Philosophy

My motivation for creating this sheet was so I could run an Alternity 2018 game in Roll20. Since others could potentially benefit, I went to the effort of adding it to Roll20's sheet offerings.

As a disciple of the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) I decided to create a fairly bare-bones sheet. I feel it does what's needed without skimping on basic Roll20-style features, such as roll-able skills.

It is not as "intelligent" as other sheets. Users will notice that certain fields that could be auto-calculated are not. Skills need to be added manually rather than containing the entire list from the rulebook. These choices were partly made to keeping things simple. But they also allow flexibility in the event of new skills, or custom rules that tweak how skill scores work.
