With the release of v2.1, the M-Space sheet is no longer maintained as an individual sheet.  Instead you should use the Mythras sheet, which has full support for the M-Space setting, plus the ability to incorporate various rules and systems from other Mythras based products.

### Instructions:
1. Open your campaign page and goto Settings->Game Settings.
2. Change the Character Sheet Template to Mythras.
3. There are also a number of other Default Sheet Settings used to toggle optional rules and systems. Some were not previously available for M-Space.  You may optionally set these as you wish.
4. When done click Save Changes.
