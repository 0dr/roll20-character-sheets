A Hero System 6th Edition character sheet for Roll20

This an alternate Hero System character sheet designed for use in heroic-level Hero System games such as Fantasy Hero or Star Hero. Characters in these games tend to have many skills, few powers, and employ weapons that generally do killing damage. The overall aim is to make Hero System as approachable as possible and character building as easy as possible without a pro-level subscription.

This sheet attempts to handle the basic bookkeeping math for characteristics, skills, powers, and complications. However, no skill names, power names, power desciptions, advantages, or limitations are included, except for the six skill enhancers, overall levels, and endurance-related choices, which are required for the internal math. Please refer to official Hero System rules publications or the official helper software Hero Designer for this information (https://www.herogames.com).

The number of skills (30 general, 7 combat, 6 maneuvers, and 10 languages) and powers (10) is hard-coded to handle the background math and for aesthetics, but should be sufficient for general use.

The first page includes a portrait section designed as a slideshow. The first shown is a "rule card" that is by default a welcome message. The second is the player's avatar image, which is currently a feature of the Dev server. The third is a sticky note for text.

The Gear section can handle both killing (up to four) and normal damage attacks (weapon, shield, and basic strength attack). For additional weapons or powers one can use macros or one of the available community-provided Hero damage API scripts such as Hero Roller https://wiki.roll20.net/Script:HeroRoller, although they require a Pro-level subscription. The basic maneuvers list is contained in a slideshow so that it can be hidden by players familiar with these rules. A second pane allows for the addition of purchased martial maneuvers. A third pane can be used for notes and treasures.

To keep the game on the simple side, this sheet favors armor activation rolls rather than the hit location system. There are input fields for the recording of armor locations, but otherwise the more advanced hit location rules are not supported at this time.

Current options include:

(1) Use Characteristic Maximums. If checked, character point costs are doubled above the standard Hero System maximums.

(2) Super-heroic Campaign Endurance. If checked, Strength costs 1 END per 5 STR to use rather than 1 END per 10 STR.

(3) Literacy Costs Character Points. If checked, literacy costs 1 CP per language selected in the Skills tab.
