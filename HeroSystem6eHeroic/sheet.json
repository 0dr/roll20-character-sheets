One of its design goals is for the sheet to be as usable as possible without the Roll20 API or Roll20 pro-level subscription. For users with this access a dice rolling script such as HeroRoller (https://wiki.roll20.net/Script:HeroRoller) will be helpful. Display of the character's avatar in the sheet portrait section is a Dev-server feature at the moment.",
