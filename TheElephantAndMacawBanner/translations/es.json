If\n            you need to add in other modifiers, use the “Mod” boxes. The max defense value is 5, but in exceptional\n            circumstances, this value can be modified in the sheet´s configuration menu by clicking the settings button\n            at the top of the sheet.\n          ",

	"skills_instructions1": "A new character begins with 20 points to\n            distribute among skills, which can be distributed according to the suggested initial configuration in the\n            rules or in any other way. Any time new learning points are earned, they can be added manually to the\n            “Points to spend” field and spent on skills. For example, if the player has 1 point to spend and earns 2\n            more learning points, simply change the value in “Points to spend” to 3.\n          ",
	"skills_instructions2": "The “All tests modifier” field is used to apply a\n            modifier to every skill test.

The player decides to make a normal melee attack (easy feat) on a creature with an Active Defense of 4. So after clicking the die beside <b>Fencing</b> for the test, the player should choose an easy feat and place -4 in the Mod field to subtract the creature´s defense.
