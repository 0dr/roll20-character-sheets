# Maximum Apocalypse

Building from scratch learning Roll20 custom sheets & grid CCS along the way.
Haven't actually played a game of Maximum Apocalypse yet & using this as a way to become familiar with the mechanics.

## Usage Notes

- The sheet will automatically calculate all derived stats: half/quarter stats, special stats, build/repair table & encumbrance
- Initiative includes modifiers from being encumbered, shaken, acute, starving & emaciated.
- Hunger conditions will highlight in red when active
- Special Abilitiy and Gear descriptions can then expanded/contracted to see the full text when needed

## Planned enhancements

- Add in roll buttons with advantage/disadvantage modifier entered by player.

## Change Log 

### November 26th 2020 v2.0

- Changed structure so repeating groups have enough room to show text & many entries won't stretch the sheet 
- Used textareas for special abilitiy and gear descriptions; user can then expand/contract these to see the full text when needed.
- Changed font for numbers from Bangers (since 1 & 7 look too similar) to Candal (one of Roll20's default fonts)
- Added sheet workers for all derived stats: half/quarter stats, special stats, build/repair table & encumbrance
- Initiative sheet worker includes modifiers from being encumbered, shaken, acute, starving & emaciated.
- Hunger conditions will highlight in red when active

### November 17th 2020 v1.0

- First version
- Full layout to match core rulebook, using Blinker & Bangers Google fonts
- Repeating sections for armor, attacks, special abilities and gear
- All input fields are manual values
