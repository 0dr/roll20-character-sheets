# Dungeon and Dragon 3.5 Light

This is a light and modern character sheet for **Dungeon and Dragon 3.5**.
Instead of overwhelming tables full of modifiers, it uses a smart system of generic modifiers that easily adapt to various situations.
This approach keeps the interface clean and user-friendly while still offering all the functionality you need for a D&D 3.5 game.
