**Breaking invisibility:** Attacking or offensive actions intended to harm another creature breaks invisibility. The priest spells *bless*, *chant*, and *prayer* are not considered attacks for this purpose. Directing an illusion or magical effect, that cannot act without direction from the caster, such as *unseen servant* or *Bigby’s hand* effects, to attack breaks invisibility.

**Noticing an invisible creature:** Creatures of 13+ intelligence *and* 10+ Hit Dice or levels gets an initial save vs spell to ***notice*** invisible creatures.
&emsp;All creatures get a save vs spell every time a minor but sufficient cause arises, such as a strange odor, small noise, object disappearing, footprints appearing.

&emsp;Creatures with immunity to illusions from 20+ intelligence, automatically succeeds their saving throw against illusionary invisibility, making it likely they will ***notice*** a magically invisible creature.
&emsp;While an actual light source may be invisible, the light emanating from it is not. This can reveal the location of an invisible character making him ***noticed***.
&emsp;A revealing action (which could range from an attack to tripping over a pile of pots) immediately negates the need for a saving throw. In such cases, the invisible character is immediately ***noticed***.
&emsp;Once a invisible creatures is ***noticed***, its general location is known and a -4 attack roll can be made or an area of effect spell can be cast against them, with a +4 to the invisible creatures saving throw.

**Pinpointing an invisible creature:** Requires the detecting creature to actually see the invisible creature. This can be achieved by *detect invisibility*, *true seeing* or by covering the invisible creature in flour or another substance.

            <li>Magical items are more resistant to damage, gaining bonuses to the saving throw. Items with a plus (a <em>sword +1</em>, for example) gain that plus as a bonus to the die roll. If the item possesses additional special abilities, it should have an extra plus for each of these.</li>
            <li>Magical items with no stated pluses should gain a bonus relative to their power. A potion would have a +1 while a miscellaneous magical item could have a +5 or +6.</li>
            <li>Further, if the saving throw is versus an attack the device was designed to counter (e.g., extreme cold vs. a <em>ring of warmth</em>), an additional bonus of +2 is allowed.</li>

            <li>Potions should save against Normal Fire at 14 (not 4 as listed)</li>
            <li>Rope should save against Lightning at 9 (not 12 as listed)</li>
