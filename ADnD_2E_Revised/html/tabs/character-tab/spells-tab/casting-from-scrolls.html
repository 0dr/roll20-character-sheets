<strong>Scroll specific spellcasting information</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Scrolls have a read time equal to the inscribed spell's cast time (PHB p. 125 / DMG p. 196)</li>
    <li>Scrolls are used up and lost if they are disrupted during casting (Sage Advice #157 p. 25)</li>
    <li>Scrolls always has a casting level (for determining level-based variables such as range, damage, duration, and resistance to dispel attempts) of one level higher than the minimum required to cast it, but never less than 6th level. In other words, the act of writing a scroll limits its power (DMG p. 196 + Sage Advice #248 p. 20+22)</li>
    <li>Scrolls are cast at the level at which they were inscribed (DMG p. 196)</li>
    <li>Scrolls require no material components to cast (PHB p. 144 / DMG p. 118)</li>
    <li>No adverse effects associated with casting the spell are suffered by the reader. These requirements or penalties have already been fulfilled or suffered by the creator of the scroll (DMG p. 196)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Scroll Spell Failure</strong>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Wizards and Priests</strong> casting scrolls containing spells of a level too high for the character to cast incurs a 5% failure rate per level between the character's present level and the level at which the spell could be cast (DMG p. 196)
        <ul>
            <li>If the DM allows for scrolls with a casting level higher than the standard given in the DMG p. 196, failure chance should be 5% between the character's present level and the scrolls casting level. (Sage Advice #248 p. 20+22)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Wizards and Priests</strong> scroll spell failure is either Total Failure (nothing happens) or Reverse / Harmful Failure effect (DMG p. 196)</li>
    <li><strong>Thieves</strong> casting scrolls have 25% failure chance. Failure is always a reverse of the effect (PHB p. 58)</li>
    <li><strong>Bards</strong> casting scrolls have 15% failure chance. Failure is always a reverse of the effect (PHB p. 61)</li>
    <li><strong>Dual/Multi-class thieves/mages</strong> uses the best failure chance, or the DM can allow the player to choose what class is trying to use the scroll. Failure follows the rules of the class the chance belongs to (Sage Advice #260 p. 23)</li>
