A creature’s aura reflects both its alignment and its experience level.\n&emsp;When a psionicist uses this power, he can see auras. Interpreting an aura requires some concentration, however. With each use of this power, the psionicist can learn only one piece of information—either the subject’s alignment or experience level, but not both simultaneously.\n&emsp;A psionicist can examine up to two auras per round (he must be able to see both subjects). Alternately, he can examine the same aura twice, to verify his first impression with a second reading or to pick up remaining information. In any case, the psionicist must make a new power check each time he attempts to interpret an aura.\n&emsp;The psionicist can be reasonably discreet when he uses this power. He doesn’t have to poke at the subject or give him the hairy eyeball. However, he does need to gaze at the subject intently. Since the range of this power is the range of vision, the psionicist can go unnoticed by maintaining his distance. If he tries to sense auras on the people he is conversing with, they certainly will notice that he is staring and probably will be uncomfortable.\n&emsp;The level of the character being analyzed affects the psionicist’s power check. The higher the subject’s experience level, the tougher it is to interpret the subject’s aura. This translates into a -1 penalty for every three levels of the subject, rounded down. For example, a psionicist reading the aura of an 8th level character would suffer a -2 penalty.\n&emsp;If the die roll for the power check is a 1, the psionicist’s reading is incomplete or slightly incorrect.

If he is in a maze or dungeon, for example, he may know the starting point is 500 yards north, but he cannot retrace his steps through the maze automatically. Radial navigation does enhance his ability to do so, however. Every time the character comes to a decision point—e.g., “should I turn right or left?”—the DM makes a power check for him. If the check succeeds, the character knows which way he came. If the roll fails, he isn’t sure. (He can still maintain the power normally, however.)\n&emsp;Radial navigation can be helpful in several ways that are not obvious. For example, teleportation and other extraordinary means of travel become simpler. Let’s say a character cannot see a particular location because he’s blindfolded. He leaves that location, but uses radial navigation to get a fix on it. That means he can still teleport back there. Furthermore, if the character has a fix on a place, he can reach it through the astral plane in just seven hours, the minimum possible (assuming of course that he can travel through the astral plane). And he can reach the same location by dimension walking (see the psychoportation discipline) with no chance of getting lost. Radial navigation can aid in telepathy, too. If the psionicist wants to make telepathic contact, and he has a fix on the target’s location, he doesn’t suffer the usual penalties for range.\n&emsp;If the character stops maintaining this power, he loses his fix on the location. He can get it back by resuming this power and making a successful power check within six hours. After six hours, the location is lost.

    'effect': 'Molecular rearrangement is the psionic equivalent of alchemy. By toying with an object’s molecular structure, the psionicist can change its fundamental nature or properties. This power cannot create matter or mass from nothing, however. Nor can it change a material’s state from liquid to solid, gas to liquid, and so on. It is best suited to converting one sort of element into another, but it can also be used for more complex operations—neutralizing a poison, for example.\n&emsp;Converting one element to another is usually a simple operation, in which one ounce of material can be changed each hour. Typical conversions of this type include steel to lead, or any metal to gold. More complex rearrangement, like changing a metal to glass or changing a wooden goblet to a ruby goblet, takes four times longer.\n&emsp;The creation of gold coins from other metals is possible, but it’s no way to get rich quick. At the rate of one ounce per hour, it would take 16 hours—about two work days—to change 10 copper pieces into 10 gold pieces, for a net profit of 9 gold pieces.\n&emsp;Molecular rearrangement is often used to create superior weapons. A psionically tempered weapon may receive a +1 on damage rolls (see “Weapon Quality” in Chapter 6 of the *DMG*). The process is time-consuming, however. For example, a typical short sword takes at least 40 hours to temper psionically. (The average short sword weighs 3 pounds, or 48 ounces, most of which is the blade.) A psionically tempered weapon does *not* automatically offer a +1 attack-roll bonus. In order to receive that bonus, the psionicist must 1) have the weaponsmithing proficiency and 2) make a successful proficiency check when he fashions the weapon.\n&emsp;The psionicist makes his power check when the process is complete. If it fails, he did not waste all his effort. The difference between the character’s die roll and his power score, multiplied by 10, equals the percentage of work which must be redone.\n&emsp;If the roll is 1, the item seems perfect but contains a hidden flaw which will cause it to break, or fail, or simply look wrong when it is put to use (the ruby goblet might leak, for example, or the sword might contain a soft portion which causes it to bend).\n&emsp;This power has no effect against living creatures weighing more than one ounce.

When a wizard uses the *astral* spell, he forms an astral body, which remains connected to his material body by a silvery cord. In contrast, a psionicist using probability travel never leaves his physical form; he brings it along. He has no cord, so, unlike the wizard, he can never die because his cord has been severed. (On the other hand, he can still be blown to bits.)\n&emsp;The astral plane boasts nothing that would attract tourists, but its two-dimensional color pools serve as highways to the outer planes. These pools, scattered randomly throughout the astral plane, provide connections to all surface layers of the outer planes.\n&emsp;Travel through the astral plane is speedy: 10 yards per minute per Intelligence point. However, distance on the astral plane does not equate to distance on other planes. After 1d6 + 6 hours of travel, the traveler reaches the color pool he sought. There is a flat 75% chance that this pool leads to the exact destination the character wants. Otherwise, it is at least 10 miles off target—maybe more.\n&emsp;The psionicist can take other persons (as defined by the *charm person* spell) along on his probability trip. Each passenger costs 12 extra PSPs initially, plus 4 extra PSPs per hour, and adds one—half hour to the time needed to find the correct color pool. Passengers must travel voluntarily; this power cannot drag a character into the astral plane against his will.\n&emsp;Combat on the astral plane is unusual. The traveler’s physical body cannot affect astral bodies in any way. However, psionic powers do work against the minds of astral travelers. Most magical items do not work in the astral plane. Magical items which are keyed to a particular plane do function there, often with enhanced effect.\n&emsp;If the psionicist simply turns off this power while in the astral plane, he doesn’t leave. Instead, he’s stranded, unable to move except by physically pushing off of solid objects (which are extremely rare in the astral plane). He’s also stranded if he runs out of PSPs or is knocked unconscious on the astral plane. The only exit from this plane is a color pool.\n&emsp;If you’d like to learn more about traveling on the astral plane, see the\n&emsp;AD&D handbook *Manual of the Planes*.\n&emsp;*Power Score*—The color pool is right where the character wants it to be.\n&emsp;*20*—The character attracts the attention of an astral creature, which may or may not be hostile, at the DM’s discretion.'

This psionic power does neither; it merely teleports something. To be rid of the creature, the psionicist must banish it, teleport it again, kill it, or control it somehow. If the creature is intelligent, the psionicist might reason with it. However, the creature is almost certain to fly into a murderous rage when it discovers its plight.\n&emsp;The psionicist can make the summoned creature materialize anywhere within 200 yards of his present position. This is a tremendous advantage, since the creature, at least initially, has no idea who summoned it. Its anger is likely to be vented against the first target it finds. However, if the psionicist’s power check result was a 2, this range is reduced to 50 yards. If the result was a 1, the creature pops in within 10 yards. Obviously, some risk is involved.\n&emsp;The psionicist chooses the plane from which the creature will come. He does not choose the creature, however; that’s determined at random. A creature from one of the elemental planes usually will be an elemental of the appropriate type. A creature from an outer plane probably will be a native of that particular plane, but it could also be a visitor, or even an adventurer who happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. In contrast, the astral or ethereal planes are a cornucopia of creatures, frequented by beings of every imaginable description.

The destination must be a place that the character knows and can picture mentally—even if he’s never actually been there. For example, a psionicist may still know a location that he has seen through a crystal ball, via a sight link, or even by scanning someone else’s mind for the information.\n&emsp;The psionicist can still teleport to a place even if it has somehow changed from the way he pictures it. For example, if a room has been rearranged, or is currently on fire, such changes won’t affect the teleport.\n&emsp;Teleports always take characters to a fixed location. For example, if a character tries to teleport into a gypsy wagon which is on the move, he’ll arrive at the wagon’s location when he last knew it. The wagon itself may be miles away by then. Also, if the character was picturing the wagon’s interior, he will teleport to the space corresponding to the wagon’s interior—which is several feet off the ground! Because the wagon itself has moved, the teleporter will fall when he arrives (imagine teleporting to a room on the fifth floor of a tower, only to discover the tower has been razed by marauders since your last visit).\n&emsp;Teleportation is instantaneous. The teleporting character simply ceases to exist in his previous location and springs into being at the destination. There is a slight, audible “pop” at both ends, as air rushes into the sudden vacuum or is instantly displaced.\n&emsp;Restraints do not affect teleportation. A character who is tied up, shackled to a wall, or buried up to his neck can still teleport. The restraints remain behind.\n&emsp;Clothing, on the other hand, does accompany a character who teleports. He may also carry small items in his grasp or wear equipment (e.g., armor) on his person, not exceeding one—fifth of his own body mass. If he doubles the amount of PSPs expended, he can carry up to three times his body mass, or take along one or two other characters on whom he has a firm grasp.\n&emsp;A character can teleport any distance, but as the distance increases, so does the chance of failure and the cost in PSPs.

    'effect': 'Like teleportation, a dimensional door takes a character from one location\n&emsp;to another. The similarity stops there, however. With dimensional door, the psionicist opens a man-sized portal which leads to the edge of another dimension. The edge acts as a lightning-quick transit system, carrying travelers to a destination chosen by the psionicist who uses this power.\n&emsp;When the psionicist uses this devotion, he creates a door leading into the alternate dimension. The door is a vaguely outlined portal, which appears in front of the psionicist. At the same time, an identical portal appears wherever he wants it, within range (see below). The door can have whatever orientation the psionicist chooses. If someone (including the psionicist) steps into either portal, he immediately steps out of the other. Both doors remain in place for as long as the psionicist maintains the power.\n&emsp;The dimension accessed by this power is not fully understood. Clearly, it has very different qualities of time and space, such that motion is greatly accelerated. For many years this transit was thought to be instantaneous, but arduous experiments by Larue d’jar Azif of Dhaztanar have proved that a very tiny bit of time does elapse. What this means is still unknown.\n&emsp;Travel via this power is disorienting. Presumably, exposure to the alternate dimension traumatizes the body in some way. As a result, a traveler is dazed and cannot attack or move for one round after stepping through a dimensional skip portal. Quick transit is advisable. People who shove only an arm through a portal suffer intense pain. Fools who poke their head through a portal must make a system shock roll; failure means they lose 50% of their current hit points and pass out.\n&emsp;Inanimate objects are not affected by exposure to the dimension’s edge. In fact, a character can throw or fire objects through a portal, and they’ll come out on the other side. Attackers suffer a -4 penalty on their to—hit rolls against targets on the other side of the dimension’s edge.\n&emsp;**Range:** The normal range of this power—i.e., the maximum distance between the two portals—is 50 yards.

Only the psionicist who opened the portal can enter it. As soon as he does, the portal closes behind him. He finds himself engulfed by an inky grayness that is virtually without features. The effect is one of extreme sensory deprivation.\n&emsp;The psionicist can travel through this gray realm at a speed of 7 leagues (21 miles) per turn. He cannot see where he is or where he’s going while in the realm. He has only his instinct to guide him, and must make a Wisdom check every turn. If these checks succeed, he’ll find himself at his chosen destination when he steps out of the realm. If any single Wisdom check fails, however, the character will stray off course by several miles. When the walker steps out of the gray realm, the DM can place him in any location, within the maximum distance from his starting point (e.g., if the psionicist walked for 10 rounds, he must be within 21 miles of his origin). It’s up to the psionicist to figure out his location; this power doesn’t help him gain his bearings.\n&emsp;Aside from getting lost, dimension walking is completely safe.

However, it’s far more satisfying to actually role—play the dream. The player creates the setting and describes his intentions, with the DM interrupting to change things arbitrarily and throw obstacles in the character’s path.\n&emsp;If the player overcomes the obstacles and solves problems inventively, the DM is justified in giving a bonus to the character’s power check.

But he cannot affect anything around him, nor can anything affect him. Even two time—shifted characters are completely invisible to each other. To the people in real time, the character simply vanishes and then reappears sometime later.\n&emsp;The character does not exist for any normal game purpose during the period when he is time shifted. If, for example, a *fireball* spell detonates in the room while the character is time shifted, the character is completely protected against its effects. In fact, unless the blast leaves visible effects (charred walls or corpses or sulfurous fumes), the character won’t even know it happened. He sees none of the intervening events.\n&emsp;This power cannot help a character escape contact, however. If someone has established contact or tangents (see Chapter 2) with the time shifter—and continues paying their maintenance cost—then the tangents or contact will still be in effect when the character returns to normal time.\n&emsp;Time shifting offers an obvious advantage in combat. A psionicist can leap one round into the future and maneuver into position for an attack. In that case, the shifter receives a +4 bonus to his attack roll. With enough time, he could even escape.\n&emsp;How long does a time shift last? If the psionicist travels one round forward, then he has one round in which to maneuver. If he travels two rounds forward, then it takes two rounds for reality to catch up. Three rounds is the limit. The farther (or longer) the trip, the more difficult it is to make, as shown in the table below.}}{{style=bottom sheet-spell-center2 sheet-spell-center3}}{{c1-1=**Time**\n**Shifted**}}{{c2-1=1 round}}{{c3-1=2 rounds}}{{c4-1=3 rounds}}{{c1-2=**Psionic**\n**Strength**\n**Cost**}}{{c2-2=3}}{{c3-2=6}}{{c4-2=12}}{{c1-3=**Power**\n**Score**\n**Modifier**}}{{c2-3=0}}{{c3-3=-2}}{{c4-3=-6}}{{effects2=&emsp;*Power Score*—No other effect.\n&emsp;*20*—The psionicist is disoriented, and suffers a -2 penalty on all die rolls for as many rounds as he intended to shift.'
