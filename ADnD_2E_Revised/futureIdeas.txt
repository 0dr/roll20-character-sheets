Scrolls / Potions
The knowledge of how to create scrolls and potions of similar function to a known spell does not just leap into his brain.

Wizards
- First cast _Enchant an Item_ (or have another do it for them) then perform whatever is needed. DMG p. 121

Default casting level for items:
Scrolls - typically one level higher than that required to cast the spell, never below 6th level - DMG p. 196 (Should probably by 7th level as the earliest a scroll can be scribed is by a priest at 7th level, DMG p. 117. This was corrected in FGaG p. 220)
Rings - 12th level unless the power requires a higher level. In that case it functions at minimum level to use the magic. DMG p. 198
Rods - DMG: Not mentioned. 12th level or minimum level. FGaG p. 230
Staves - 8th level unless otherwise stated. DMG p. 207
Wands - 6th level unless otherwise stated. DMG p. 210
